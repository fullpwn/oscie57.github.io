        <h1>Using DVD-Rs (Burned Games) on a Wii</h1>
        <p>I am quite poor to be honest, but I really want to enjoy Wii games. I recently found a big stack of DVD-R discs from a while ago, and I wondered; "Can I burn Wii/GameCube/Wii U games to these?". For Wii U, no, you cannot. For GameCube, while it is possible, it is extremely annoying so I wont go into it. But, Wii, on the other hand, isn't too difficult, as long as you know what you are doing. For burning the actual games to a disc, see "<a href="../pages/burning.html">Burning Wii Games to a DVD-R (Coming Soon)</a>".</p>
        <ul>
            <ol>0. Your Wii MUST be <a href="https://wii.guide">modded beforehand</a>, with <a href="https://wii.guide/priiloader">Priiloader</a> installed. Your Wii must also be able to read DVD-R discs. Chances are it does, but I am not the one to confirm it.</ol>
            <ol>1. Open up Priiloader by holding "reset" upon boot.</ol>
            <ol>2. Make your way to "System Menu Hacks" and press "Up" twice on the Wii Remote to get to "Force Disc  Games to run under IOS249"</ol>
            <ul>
                <ol>Note: if this IOS is a stub, then whoops you've got an issue. Make sure to have <a href="https://wii.guide/cios">cIOS</a> installed.</ol>
            </ul>
            <ol>3. Press "Save Settings" and then press B to get to the main menu.</ol>
            <ol>4. Go down to "Settings" and make your way down to "Use System Menu IOS" and switch it to "off".</ol>
            <ol>5. Below this setting, you should now see "IOS to use for SM". Press the left button on the DPAD until you see "249".</ol>
            <ol>6. Once you have done this, make sure to press "Save Settings" and press B to go to the main menu.</ol>
            <ol>7. Go to "System Menu" and press A. You should return to the Home Menu.</ol>
        </ul>
        <p>This is how I got DVD-Rs to work on my Wii, so I hope it works for you too! Everything I do is done on 4.3E so results may vary depending on region. Hopefully, if you've done it right (and your Wii supports DVD-Rs), your disc will load in the Disc Channel.</p>
