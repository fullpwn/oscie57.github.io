        <h1>Running Korean discs on a European Wii</h1>
        <p>I have been learning Korean recently (specifically Hangul at the moment) and I thought, what if I played some Wii games in Korean to get used to the language, so I burned some games to DVD-Rs and played them. Some games however, dont really work. I had Rhythm Heaven Fever (리듬 세상 Wii) burned and at hand so I tried it and it didn't work at first, so go <a href="../pages/dvdr.html">here</a> for guidance on getting DVD-Rs to run on your Wii.</p>
        <ul>
            <ol>0. If you are using a burned Disc, your Wii must be DVD-R compatible!</ol>
            <ol>1. Make sure you have setup <a href="https://wii.guide/wiiflow">WiiFlow</a> on your Wii.</ol>
            <ol>2. Insert the Disc in your Wii normally, DO NOT open it through the normal Disc Channel.</ol>
            <ol>3. Open up WiiFlow through however you have set it up, either through a forwarder, or in the Homebrew Channel.</ol>
            <ol>4. Move your Wii "Cursor" to the bottom of the screen, you should see a Disc icon. Press on it and the game should load.</ol>
        </ul>
        <p>That is what I did and it worked fine for me, though your results may vary. Currently, I havent been able to get Wii Play: Motion (Wii 리모컨플러스로 즐기는 버라이어티 게임 박스) working, but other games such as New Super Mario Bros. Wii (뉴 수파 마리오브라더스 Wii) and Wii Sports work fine with this method.</p>
