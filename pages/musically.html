        <h1>Installing Musical.ly on Android (Updated)</h1>
        <p>Hey there, have you used Musical.ly before? Have you wanted to use it again? Well, follow this guide and you'll be able to use it in no time! I was bored one night and wondered, "can I install musical.ly again?", so I tried all the versions I could until I finally got one that worked. You can follow this guide so you can have it done in minutes, whereas it took me a couple hours to figure it out :D. The versions that work are 7.0.0 and up, though for this we will be using 7.5.0 because it supports Mobile Phone login and that's what I need to be able to log in.</p>
        <h3>Downloads and preperations.</h3>
        <p>For this, you are going to need the APK file and an Android device. It only works on Android, unless you have an emulator or Android Subsystem for Windows (Win11 Only)! You'll only need one of the ones below, they are just different links incase one goes down.</p>
        <h4>Downloads</h4>
        <ul>
            <ol><a href="https://guide.oscie.net/assets/musical-ly-7-5-0.apk">Download 1 (Direct Download)</a></ol>
            <ol><a href="https://tiktok.en.uptodown.com/android/download/1742610">Download 2 (UpToDown)</a></ol>
            <ol><a href="https://mega.nz/file/rdgGnYpI#aCp6cjwdMTP4yGx8jE4A5cjkXeKYrdYptPg9B0i-zkw">Download 3 (Mega.NZ)</a></ol>
        </ul>
        <p>Alright, lets do this!</p>
        <ul>
            <ol>1 - Download the APK file. This can be from one of the links above.</ol>
            <ol>2 - Put the APK file somewhere on your device, either through an SD card or directly downloading to it.</ol>
            <ol>3 - Open your File Manager of choice and locate the APK file.</ol>
            <ol>4 - Tap the APK file and press install (if it is telling you to enable Unknown Sources, enable it)</ol>
            <ol>5 - You should see it on your home screen, tap it and it should open!</ol>
        </ul>
        <p>And thats it, as simple as that. You should now have Musical.ly 7.5.0 on your Android device! Just a note, there will be some things that dont work like searching, and alot of features will be missing but that should be expected from an app that was released in 2018.</p>
